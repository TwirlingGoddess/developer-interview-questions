# Developer Interview Questions

This is a community resource for questions to ask when interviewing for a software engineering position. Some questions may be applicable for non-technical jobs too.

_If you are the interviewee:_ Interviews are a two-way street, and when you are interviewing for a role, it is important to ask questions to get a sense of the role, organization, and team to make sure it aligns with your interests, values, and goals. Pick and choose the questions that are most important to you.

_If you are the interviewer_: These questions can help you better explain more about your organization, which will help the interviewee tremendously.
